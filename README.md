# ProjectOne - QrAdventure

## App Overview
Our android app is called QrAdventure! It's a game about scanning various QR codes in the real world, which are each associated with a unique name and visual representation. Players can collect these codes to compete with their friends to see who has the highest overall score, the most codes, or the highest scoring QR code. The app also features an interactive map that helps players locate nearby codes!

## Acknowledgements
The creator of the QrAdventure mobile app is Team 26 - also known as Act Now Think Later. The members of this team consist of Abrar Zahin, Jaskirat Saggu, Jvon Mikael Chavez, Carl Rogador, Yuri Sanchez, and Daniel Sacro. This app could not have been a success without the contributions of each and every member, and we also owe a great deal of gratitude to our TA, Ranit Ganguly, who provided support and guidance to the team throughout the Winter 2023 semester.

Furthermore, QrAdventure was a group project created for the course CMPUT 301 (Intro. to Software Engineering) at the University of Alberta. The idea of a code-collecting mobile game is also not our own and should be credited to the professors of the course, Dr. Abram Hindle and Dr. Ildar Akhmetov.
